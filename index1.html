    <h1> My favorite hobby is <br><span id="myname">Skateboarding</span></h1>
    <p> Skateboarding is my favorite pastime because it makes me feel free. When I board my face is it the wind and I feel like a horse gallopping in a meadow. It is also fun because you can learn many tricks such as the ollie (jumping with your skateboard), a kick-turn (using your feet and physics to turn when you are half way up a ramp), and riding without pumping (you use your feet to move the top half of the board up and bring it down creating momentum to move).
